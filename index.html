        <p>
          Juicebox was found roaming the streets of Texas as a baby,
          and was spirited away to the Seattle Humane Society, where he
          first met Kayla. Kayla was trying to get over a difficult breakup,
          and thought a dog might soothe her troubled soul. Although she
          had intended to get a medium-sized, or even small, dog, Juicebox
          stole her heart with his adorable puppy ways, and the two became
          fast friends. He's pretty much the best dog. He is what is commonly
          called a "mutt" or "mongrel", or simply "not inbred", with ancestors
          ranging from the Karelian Bear Dogs of Finland, to the Rottweilers
          of ancient Rome, to the Huskies of Siberia. Whatever his ancestry,
          he is just about the sweetest and best dog you could possibly ask for.

          When Juicebox was first brought home, he was not yet house trained.
          One day, while peeing on the floor in the common room of my co-op, one of
          my housemates commented "Wow, it just keeps coming! He's like a little juicebox!"
          The rest, as they say, is history.
